# Privacy Policy

**Last Updated: December 23, 2025**

## Introduction

This Privacy Policy describes how our gold price tracking mobile application ("the App") handles information when you use our services. We are committed to protecting your privacy and being transparent about our data practices.

## Information We Do Not Collect

We want to be clear: **we do not collect, store, or process any personal information**. This includes but is not limited to:

- Name, email address, or phone number
- Location data
- Device identifiers that can be linked to you personally
- Contact lists
- Photos or media files
- Financial information
- Any other personally identifiable information (PII)

## Anonymous Usage Data

To improve the App's performance and user experience, we collect limited anonymous usage data that cannot be used to identify you personally. This may include:

- App crashes and error reports
- General usage statistics (e.g., features used, session duration)
- Device type and operating system version
- App version information

This data is aggregated and anonymized, meaning it cannot be traced back to individual users.

## How We Use Anonymous Data

The anonymous usage data we collect is used solely for:

- Improving app performance and stability
- Fixing bugs and technical issues
- Understanding which features are most useful to users
- Enhancing user experience

## Third-Party Services

The App may use third-party services (such as analytics tools) that collect anonymous usage data on our behalf. These services are bound by their own privacy policies and do not collect personal information through our App.

## Data Sharing

Since we do not collect personal information, we have no personal data to share, sell, or disclose to third parties. Anonymous usage data may be shared with service providers solely for the purposes of app improvement and analytics.

## Children's Privacy

Our App does not knowingly collect information from children under the age of 13. Since we do not collect personal information from any users, our App is suitable for all ages.

## Data Security

While we do not collect personal information, we still implement reasonable security measures to protect the anonymous usage data we collect from unauthorized access or disclosure.

## Your Rights

Since we do not collect or store personal information, there is no personal data for you to access, modify, or delete. If you have concerns about anonymous usage data, you may stop using the App at any time.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated "Last Updated" date. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically.
